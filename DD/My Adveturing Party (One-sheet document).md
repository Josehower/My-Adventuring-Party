## Gameâ€™s story

20 years have passed since the catastrophe. We live in difficult times, nothing is as it used to be. This strange fog that covers our world has not only condemned us to these endless cloudy days, the electric power continues to not work, making our old technology useless.

The world has been filled with hideous creatures and some of us have begun to experience extra-human capabilities. We have become mercenaries, and gold has once again become the most precious commodity. no path is safe, there are no more cities or towns to call home, we roam like nomads, we fight tribal, it doesn't matter if they are horrors or other humans, our team is our family. We take the resources we find in our path and we never look back.

Some of us still believe that we can find the source of this insufferable fog, and lift this world out of its misery. But until then, the only goal is to make ourselves invincible so that we can live without fear tomorrow.

## Distinct modes of gameplay

Players must create their own group of adventurers, for each member of his party they must choose between some pre-established classes such as Warrior, Mage, Healer and Archer.

Each player must train their own team through fighting between other teams or hunting monsters. At the end of these fights they will receive gold based on their results, with which they can buy improvements to their characters and raise their combat level.

The combat will be carried out through actions taken by each player (or AI) in alternate turns. The player must strategically select what actions to take in order to get the advantage that will lead to victory.
