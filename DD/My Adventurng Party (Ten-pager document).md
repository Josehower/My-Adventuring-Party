## Game Story

Twenty years ago a medium-sized asteroid struck central Asia causing a large cloud of dust to cover the earth's surface for weeks. Fortunately, the size of the asteroid was not enough to extinguish all life on earth, however strange things began to happen shortly after.

From the epicenter of the catastrophe, a dense fog began to emerge that, although it allowed sunlight to pass through, made every day cloudy and cold, for some reason that cannot be explained, the electric power stopped working, the oil reserves crystallized and strange creatures attacked the large cities reducing them to rubble in a matter of months.

Without vehicles or electric power, civilization as we know it ceased to exist and once again everything seemed stuck in a strange medieval period. Some humans now known as **HELDEN** began to acquire superhuman abilities, some became stronger, others more agile and others were able to converge a strange magical energy to use it causing or healing injuries.

Today almost nobody remembers our civilized past, men and women associate in small groups to survive, they pay with gold and merchandise to **HELDEN** groups to protect them either from the creatures that lurk or from other **HELDEN** who seek to take what they find in its wake.

Some still believe that the source of this insufferable mist can be found and destroyed, thereby lifting this world out of its misery.

Others just want to become invincible and take control over all the others.

## Game Flow

The My Adventuring Party player has to create his own group of HELDEN and fight with them to defeat bosses or other HELDEN groups to get rewards and discover the location of the source of the fog. The challenges will get more and more difficult, and the task of the player is to train his group so that he can become invincible and bring this world out of its misery.

Each HELDEN in the group will have a class that will give them a unique skill set and skill stats to use in battle. The player has to find the best strategy to defeat the different HELDEN bosses and teams that separate him from the glory and the truth about the origin of the fog.

## Player Charachter

At the beginning of the game, the player must decide the class of his main HELDEN, the name of this HELDEN will be taken from his account nickname. This will be the player's character and he is the only HELDEN that cannot be abandoned from the party. (the only way to change his class is to restart the account, which will lose all the player's advancement)

Although his abilities will be the same as any other HELDEN in his class, he will gain slightly more benefit from the skill enhancement items than the other HELDEN in the group, making him stronger.

The game begins when the player meets a merchant in one of the multiple nomadic cities of the world who will introduce him to the adventure, from which the player will begin to obtain some quests that will lead him to delve into the story.

## Game play

The gameplay is divided on two diferent phases:

  - ## Party Managment

    This phase is where the player create and manage his party of **HELDEN**, he uses gold to buy items that allow him to improve the stats of his team members, in order to make them powerfull and win battles easily. The player can have up to fifteen **HELDEN** but he can only use five into battle, what allow the player create different party compositions as needed.

    ### ITEMS, GOLD and SOUL STONES

    The gold on My Adventuring Party is the economy resource of the game. With this the player can buy items that allow him or her improve his or her team, or perform some actions on battle. The gold not only is used to buy items but, can be used to buy extra features as extra **HELDEN** slots or exceed the daily maximum battle encounters amount.

    The player get gold overtime until the gold reach a cap, this cap can be augmented whit one special resource called **SOUL STONE** which is the most rare resource on the game.

    The gold and sometimes items are the reward of the battles, soulStones can also be acquired from battles but this have a really low drop rate.

    the Soul Stones can be exchanged for gold but no gold can buy Soul Stones.

    ### HELDEN stats

    Each **HELDEN** has a limited set of **skill stats** at a certain point that can only be overcome by leveling up. To unlock a higher level for a **HELDEN**, the player must reach a minimum amount of total **skill stats**. This minimum amount of total **skill stats** to level up will grow exponentially, making each level more and more difficult to acquire.

    after **level 10**, the requirement to level up wouldnt be only skillstats but also spending **SOUL STONES** which are the most hard resource to get on the game.

  - ## Battle mode

    The battle phase is where the action takes place, this is what makes My Adventure Party and strategy game. Here each of the parts involve on the battle (player vs player or player vs IA defined on GDD) would take turns to perform actions that would define the results of the battle.

    Each player would decide in between different turns which actions to perform, the turn itself have some steps wich makes the strategic part of the game taking place.
  


### HELDEN classes

  Each of the HELDEN on the game have a class asigned to him. The avaliable clases are:

  - Warrior:

    This HELDEN is phisicaly stronger as any other counterparts, he is the frontline figther of the party and is the only member capable to fight on melee range. He can recieve more damage before being defeated. Unfortunatly he cannot cause a lot of damage by himself.

  - Gunner:

    This HELDEN is faster and more agile than any other counterpart, he is able to use long distance weapons and pistols to cause a lot of physical damage to his opponents, he feels better fighting from a distance. It is not capable of withstanding much damage, but it can cause serious physical injury.

  - Mage:

    This HELDEN has the unique ability to use the magical energy that emanates from this new world, it is not really difficult to beat when alone, but you have to worry about the amount of magic damage it can cause when covered by an ally.

  - Healer:

    This HELDEN is not capable of killing anyone by himself, the amount of damage caused by him is the least of all the other counterparts, however he has the unique ability to heal with his magic power, and this is something that will mark the difference in battle.
