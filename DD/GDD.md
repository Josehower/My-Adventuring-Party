The game progress as the diferent HELDEN on the team grow whit level, and also the player have accses to more resources because of the expedition and the treasure droped by bigger opponents.

each HELDEN on the first version of the game can get levels until lvl 10 that is the cap for this version, after that the HELDEN can get more stats but the cap on his stats is permanent.

When a Helden get a new level all his skills get a small boost however the real power remain on the augmented cap of skill sets that unlock. see([Helden](#helden))

## HELDEN <a id="helden"></a>

![Helden Frame](./design-assets/helden-frame.png)

### HELDEN Leveling Up

Each HELDEN begin the adventure on LVL 1 and whit the same amount of base skill Stats, this base skill Stats are different for each class.

The different stats of a helden will grow with each leveling up, despite of that some stats growth are controled by the player and others dont.

the player can control how the skill battle stats of the HELDEN grow, for that he or her have two ways to enhance the skill stat of each HELDEN. **stats enhancer cookies** ([see here](#enhancer-items)) and **expeditions** ([see here](#expeditions)).

Each helden can have only a maximum of five stat enhancments by level, after each enhancement he or her will gain one experience shard, the experiences Shards reset on each level.

after a leveling up the next changes will happen:

1. The maximum amount of stats for each skill stat will be upgraded
1. All the skill Stats will be slightly bumped up (some stats will have an extra increment by class )
1. on lvl 3 / 7 / 10 the HELDEN will get a new SA slot AND A VE BOOST
1. after lvl 7 the HELDEN can be transform into SOUL STONES (NON a feature for UPLeveled final)

|lvl  | skill stats increment            | total SA slots | can be stoned? LOL|
|:----|:--------------------------------:|:---------------|:-----------------:| 
|2    | 5%(+ 1def)     + class increment | 2              | NO                |
|3    | 10%(+ 1def)  + 5%VE + class incr | 3              | NO                |
|4    | 10%(+ 1def)    + class increment | 3              | NO                |
|5    | 10%(+ 1def)    + class increment | 3              | NO                |
|6    | 10%(+ 1def)    + class increment | 3              | NO                |
|7    | 15%(+ 1def)  + 10%VE + class inc | 4              | YES               |
|8    | 15%(+ 1def)    + class increment | 4              | YES               |
|9    | 15%(+ 1def)    + class increment | 4              | YES               |
|10   | 20%(+ 2def)  + 20%VE + class inc | 5              | YES but... REALLY?|


### Stats <a id="stats"></a>

each helden have his own set of stats, however not all the stats can be controled by the player this means there are two different kind of stats:

  - Hard Stats: This stats are fixed on the HELDEN they grow whit the rules of the game and the player cannot modify them directly.

    - Level(LvL): Represents the power of the HELDEN, despite each HELDEN grow on his o her own peace on average a HELDEN whit more level is powerfull.

    - Experiences Shards (ExS): Represent the amount of stats enhancements that a HELDEN have performed for his or her actual LvL, each HELDEN can have five enchancements per Level.

    - Special Actions (SA):  how many Special Actions can the HELDEN perform on one battle (this grow whit level).

    - Damage Nature: This is the type of damage that the HELDEN cause, this is determinated by class. there are two posible damage nature types, physical(warrior and gunner), supernatural(mage and healer)

    - Battle position: this stat is only relevant for battle and is determinated by class. All classes are ranged with exeption the warrior that is melee.

  - Skill Stats: this stats can be modified by the player and are part of the strategy of the player, meaning two different HELDEN can have the same lvl and class but be totally different. (ie, strong against soul damage, or with an insane amount of VP).

    - Vital Energy (VE):  Damage able to handle before be Unconcious.

    - Action Points (AP): Base number used to calculate the amount of points his or her actions cause.(ie. how much heal or how much damage cause whit his basic atack).

    - supernatural Defense (SD): percentage of probability to negate the damage of this type (this stat have a hard cap of 30 what means 30% and should be rarely upgraded)

    - physical Defense (PD): percentage of probability to negate the damage of this type (this stat have a hard cap of 30 what means 30% and should be rarely upgraded)


## Stats Cap

All the stats for a HELDEN have a cap based on his or her lvl:

|lvl  | VE    | AP   |   SD and PD           |
|:----|:-----:|:-----|:---------------------:| 
|1    |100    | 15   |   base +2             |
|2    |200    | 25   | init value +2         |
|3    |350    | 40   | init value +4 HARD 30 |
|4    |600    | 75   | init value +4 HARD 30 |
|5    |1000   | 130  | init value +4 HARD 30 |
|6    |2000   | 230  | init value +4 HARD 30 |
|7    |4000   | 430  | hard 30               |
|8    |7500   | 780  | hard 30               |
|9    |13000  | 1400 | hard 30               |
|10   |35000  | 4000 | hard 30               |

!!!!!!!!!!!

cada nivel tiene un maximo de expedisiones o cookies a las que puede ser mandado un helden. (esto quiere decir que los helden crecen de manera distinta dependiendo las cookies que se gasten en ellos, por otro lado los helden que se armen una vez se hallan desbloqueado las cookies mas poderozas pueden ser crecidos mejor lo que aumenta la rejugabilidad)

!!!!!!!!!

### Expeditions <a id="expeditions"></a>

(the cookies have to be a way to push the boundries of the HELDEN)

Expeditions are the usual way a HELDEN grow, in thouse the HELDEN go for a training during a period of time, and when he came back he get some stats enhancements. The enhancements that expedition gives allow the HELDEN grow in a balanced way, and sometimes give more bonuces as a normal enhancement cookie.

The more lvl have the HELDEN more time would be the duration of the expedition. send a HELDEN into expedition cost some gold based on the level of the HELDEN.

After the completion of the expedition the helden would get an Experience Slot filled (after 5 the HELDEN will Lvl Up).

After 5th expedition on a lvl 10 the HELDEN cannot go into expedition anymore (he is an ELDER he dont need to train!!)

The player begin with the ability to send only one HELDEN into expedition at time, he can Unlock 3 more slots with gold and the last with SoulStones.

1rst Slot : free
2nd Slot : 1000
3rd Slot : $10000
4rth Slot : $100000
5rth Slot : §200

**around 11 days for HELDEN to be lvl 10 without cookies**

The expedition have some probabilities to grow each of  VE and AP stats, DP and SP share the same grow slot by a 50% probability(expedition will grow one of them but not both) each HELDEN have 3 probabilites to grant a boost, if all fail dont grant any boost. each class have a primary stat that give 100% on the least increment.

Common increment: 80% of the time (100% on the primary stat )
Uncommon increment: 50% of the time
Rare increment: 10% of the time

for each of VE and AP the system check if a Rare increment will occur. If that happens dont check any other. if the check fails
go for the next one.

for DP and SP, the system first check which stat will be incremented, then check if the rare increment will occur, if the check fail go to the next one and so on.

Movement in the game
Objects – how to pick them up and move them 
Actions, including whatever switches and buttons are used, interacting with objects, and what means of communication are used
Combat – If there is combat or even conflict, how is this specifically modeled?

# Combat Phase <a id="combat"></a>


```
NOTES: 
1 TURN / MINUTE
BATTLES BETWEEN 4-6MIN   EXTENSIBLE UNTIL 6-10 MINUTES   NO LONGER THAN 15 MIN
```

The battle phase is where the action takes place, this is what makes My Adventure Party and strategy game. Here each of the parts involve on the battle would take turns to perform actions that would define the results of the battle.

Each player would decide in between different turns which actions to perform, the turn itself have some steps wich makes the strategic part of the game taking place.

when a HELDEN or creature (character), lose all his VE fall unconcious and cannot battle any more

the first player on make all opponent player unconcious win the combat.

If after 10 rounds the combat have not a winner, the VE of all standing characters is divided by:

turn 11 :  4	
turn 12 :  16	
turn 13 :  64	
turn 14 :  256	
turn 15 :  1024
... still alive!!!!
turn 16 : draw...

on a draw no player get rewards.

## Combat Actions: 

there are Two types of actions on my Adventure Party Combat, **Tactical** and **Damaging**:

  - Tactical Actions: are actions that dont cause damage to the Characters on combat, things as healing, revive, or rasing defenses.
  - Damaging Actions: are as named, actions that deal damage to a target.

- each turn of the combat have 3 steps:

Pre: only tactical Actions can be performed
damage: only Damaging Actions can be performed
post: only Tactical Actions can be performed

Each of this steps are resolve in order, first tactical actions that where targeted as pre, will be performed, then the damage actions
and last all the post actions (if the target of an action is unconcious at the moment of the post action resolution, the action will be skipped).

- pre and post: when a player is declaring actions if the action is a tactical action he or she have to declare if wanted to resolve pre or post damage.

- damage: all the damage will be applied at the same time, that means that even if a character die as result of the damage, he will cause damage with his attack.

## characther actions

On each turn each HELDEN or Creature can perform one of the following actions:

- Basic Attack: (is allways a damagin action)
Damage based on his AP.

- Special Action: (can be a tactic action or a damagin action)
Class Abilitity of the helden or creature. (can only perform the ability if have one SA avaliable)

- Battle item:
Battle item usage. (is allways a tactic action)

Each of this action need a target and if is a tactical action need a timing trigger (pre or post).

## Damage resolution

For each damaging action performed the game should preform at least 1 damage attempt, to decide if the damaged is applied or resisted.

the algoritm to perform is the following:

1. determinate if the damage nature of the performer of the damaging action
1. determinate the defense of the target for the damaging nature of the performer
1. determinate if the damage will be resisted or not based on the defense (the damage should be resisted un porcentage of times equals to the defense value of the target.).
1. apply damage if needed.


## Combat positions

![Combat phase](./design-assets/combat-positions.png)

At the begining of the combat, the screen show the two opposite teams one on front of the other in one horizontal way, the warriors are positionated a little bit towards the middle.

there are two positions on the combat, **the front Line position** and the **covered position**

this positions are important for the damage resolution.

Every time one action have as target a character on a covered position, if there is at least one character alive on the front line of the same team as the target, the action is splited into two damage Attempts, one for the target and one for the melee character on the front line.

if one of thouse result in a success the damage dealt is the half of the total damage attempt.

if there are no more concious melee character on the target character team there is only one damage Attempt for the hole damage.

<br>

  - Gold from Battle Encounter:

    The bigest source of gold came from battles the player would have some reward after each encounter that finish as a victory, the player dont gain anithyng for a fail encounter. the amount of gold founded on the battle will be based on the level of the enemy defeated.

    | Enemy defeated lvl |    single enemy     | party Gold drop rate     |
    |:------------------ |:--------------------|:-------------------------|
    | 1                  |         $5-20       | $20    -  $100           |
    | 2                  |        -->/5        | $50    -  $200           |
    | 3                  |        -->/5        | $100   -  $500           |
    | 4                  |        -->/5        | $250   -  $1000          |
    | 5                  |        -->/5        | $500   -  $2000          |
    | 6                  |        -->/5        | $1000  -  $4000          |
    | 7                  |        -->/5        | $2000  -  $6000          |
    | 8                  |        -->/5        | $3000  -  $10000         |

    |Rare            |50%                |

## SOUL STONES: 

The SOUL STONES on My Adventuring Party are the most rare resource. With this resource the player can get special items and unlock special game features. Is also well known that when a HELDEN reach level 10 each level will have an aditional Soul Stone Requirement.

<br>

### How to SOUL STONES
